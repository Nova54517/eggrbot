You're going to need:

* Node.js
* Some knowledge
* a computer (so original)
* a discord account

***

First of all, edit the `config.json` file to configure the bot.
Replace all the example values with the bot token, prefix, name and description

Second, run the startup files. If you are running Windows (`bootbot.bat`) and Mac or Linux (`botbi.sh`)

Third, check 4 errors and you got the bot running.

**I'm learning Node.js so don't be picky**
